# üîî Real-Time Wireless Quiz Buzzer (ESP-NOW)

A wireless quiz buzzer system built on the ESP32 platform, utilizing the ultra-fast ESP-NOW protocol for reliable, low-latency communication.  
This project features a real-time, web-based judge interface powered by WebSockets, ensuring fair, millisecond-accurate scoring for any game show or trivia competition.

This project is designed to solve the problem of subjectivity and human error in determining who pressed the button first, with millisecond-level precision.

## üí° Concept & How It Works

The core idea is to separate the "Button" (Sender) from the "Brain" (Host).

### 1. Button Unit (Sender) ‚Äî The "Dumb" Device
| Property         | Value                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware         | ESP32-C3 SuperMini                                                    |
| Responsibility   | When the physical button is pressed, immediately send a packet via ESP-NOW (e.g. ID `'A'`). |
| WiFi Connection  | None. The Sender does **not** join any WiFi network.                 |
| Knowledge of Game State | None. It doesn't know who already won.                       |
| Why It's Fast    | No TCP/IP, no HTTP, just raw ESP-NOW broadcast to Host MAC.           |

### 2. Central Unit (Host) ‚Äî The "Smart" Device
| Property           | Value                                                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware           | ESP32-WROOM32                                                                          |
| Responsibility #1  | Listen for ESP-NOW packets from all Senders.                                           |
| Responsibility #2  | Decide the winner (first press wins), then lock the round to ignore late presses.     |
| Responsibility #3  | Act as WiFi AP (`"Smart Bell"`) and serve a web dashboard + WebSocket for the judge.  |

## üîß System Architecture

The project uses a **Star Network Topology**:

- The Host (ESP32-WROOM32) acts as the center.
- All Sender units (ESP32-C3) transmit directly to the Host using ESP-NOW.
- The Judge connects to the Host's Access Point over WiFi and controls the round.

# üîå Hardware Design (Wiring)

## Host Unit (ESP32-WROOM32)

| Signal / Pin | Connection       |
|--------------|------------------|
| 5V / 3V3 / GND | Power via USB cable |
| GPIOs        | (None needed for basic demo) |
| Extra Peripherals | Not required |

> Just power it via USB.  
> It will create WiFi AP + run the judge UI + receive ESP-NOW packets.

## Sender Unit (ESP32-C3)

> Very simple, no external resistor needed.

| Sender Part       | Connects To                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Push Button Leg 1 | GPIO 5 (or pin defined in code)      |
| Push Button Leg 2 | GND                                  |
| Power             | Via USB or battery                   |
| Internal Pull-up  | Yes (`INPUT_PULLUP` in firmware)     |

**In code:**
```cpp
pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
// Button press is detected when the pin reads LOW.
```

### Bagian 2: Proses Flashing (Ringkasan Tabel)

Ini adalah bagian heading dan tabel ringkasan langkah. Format tabel di Markdown menggunakan `|` (pipa) dan `-` (setrip).

## üîÅ Flashing & Pairing Process

This sequence matters because the Sender must know the Host's MAC address.

### üìù Step Overview

| Step | Action | Device | Output / Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Flash Host firmware (`Quiz_Buzzer_Host/src/main.cpp`) | ESP32-WROOM32 (Host) | Host boots, starts AP, prints MAC address |
| 2 | Read MAC address from Serial Monitor (115200 baud) | ESP32-WROOM32 (Host) | Get Host's ESP-NOW / AP MAC |
| 3 | Paste that MAC into the Sender code (`broadcastAddress[]`) | ESP32-C3 (Sender) | Sender knows where to send packets |
| 4 | Set a unique team ID (`TEAM_A`, `TEAM_B`, etc.) | ESP32-C3 (Sender) | Identify which team won |
| 5 | Flash each Sender with personalized firmware | ESP32-C3 units | All Senders report to same Host with unique IDs |

### üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Instructions

#### ‚úÖ Flash the Host
* Put the Host code (`main.cpp`) into `Quiz_Buzzer_Host/src/`
* Upload to ESP32-WROOM32

#### üîç Get Host MAC Address
* Open Serial Monitor at 115200
* Copy the printed MAC address

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Configure Each Sender
* Open `Quiz_Buzzer_Sender/src/main.cpp`
* Set `broadcastAddress` to the Host's MAC
* Set a unique team ID:
    ```cpp
    const char* TEAM_ID = "TEAM_A"; // or TEAM_B, TEAM_C, ...
    ```

#### üöÄ Flash Each Sender
* Upload code to each ESP32-C3
* All Senders now report to the same Host

### üéÆ How to Use (Operation Flow)

| Step | Actor | Action | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Setup | Power on all units (1 Host + all Senders) | Host boots AP + Web Server + WebSocket. Senders idle. |
| 2 | Judge | On phone/laptop, connect to `Smart Bell` WiFi | Judge joins Host's local network |
| 3 | Judge | Open browser &rarr; go to `http://192.168.4.1` | Judge Interface (control panel) loads |
| 4 | Judge | Press "START ROUND" in the UI | Unlocks system: `sistemTerkunci = false` |
| 5 | Contestants | Press physical buttons | First Sender sends ESP-NOW packet |
| 6 | Host FW | Detects 1st valid press, sets `sistemTerkunci = true` | Ignores further presses |
| 7 | Dashboard | Web UI auto-updates via WebSocket | Shows "WINNER: A", triggers sound |
| 8 | Judge | Press "RESET" in UI | System unlocks for next round |

### üöß Current Limitations & Weaknesses

| Limitation | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Security** | WiFi AP is open (no WPA2). Use only in controlled environments. |
| **No Logging** | No persistent match log. Resetting Host clears history. |
| **Range** | ~100‚Äì200m line-of-sight. Walls reduce range. |
| **Power** | Units expect continuous USB/battery. No deep sleep optimization. |
